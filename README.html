<h2 id="kit-to-download-and-start-your-new-project">Kit to download and start your new project</h2>
<p>  This kit was created to save your time, because it includes css and js libraries. So you don&#39;t have to go to internet and download all of them separately, you already have them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CSS:</strong><ul>
<li><a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate.css</a> - Library of ready animations created by Daniel Eden</li>
<li><a href="http://daneden.github.io/Toast/">Toast CSS Grid</a> - Easy-to-tweak css grid, that I use everytime I need a grid layout.</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ComePot/bb607218367f9575ee06#file-colloro-sass">Colloro.sass</a> - The color library I created myself, so you won&#39;t look for nice UI colors. That also saved me a lot of time.</li>
<li><a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a> - Maybe one of the most useful things ever created for any web project. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>JS:</strong><ul>
<li><a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> - The most popular JavaScript library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-stuff-used-here-">What stuff used here:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>SASS</strong> - as a powerfull CSS processor</li>
<li><strong>JADE</strong> - powerfull HTML templating language</li>
<li><strong>Nice managed</strong> - This kit is really easy to understand. All the files imported into Styles.sass that will compile every library and every line into one file.(Depends how you will manage your compiler. I used Prepros.io, since I am on Windows)</li>
</ul>
